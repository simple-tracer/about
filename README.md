# About Simple Tracer

On the 31st of December 2019, the world as we knew it began to crumble. As we celebrated the begining of a new decade, a deadly new virus was spreading in Wuhan, China. And it spread fast, one infected person could spread COVID-19 to thousands of people. As we built this project, we were still fighting the pandemic and the battle is very far from over. We've seen first hand, the effect a pandemic can leave. 

One thing we've observed is the effectiveness of contact tracing as a utility to fight the pandemic. So we built a tool that allows for contact tracers to identify people who enter the same building. This means that if one person who entered a shop gets infected, the people who were at the shop get a message that serves a quarntine order and it is logged that they have entered quarantine.
