# About Simple Tracer

On the 31st of December 2019, the world as we knew it began to crumble. As we celebrated the beginning of a new decade, a deadly new virus was spreading in Wuhan, China. And it spread fast, one infected person could spread COVID-19 to thousands of people. As we built this project, we were still fighting the pandemic and the battle is very far from over. We've seen first hand, the effect a pandemic can leave. 

One thing we've observed is the effectiveness of contact tracing as a utility to fight the pandemic. So we built a tool that allows for contact tracers to identify people who enter the same building. The idea behind it is that any administration could deploy it in under an hour. This means that if one person who entered a shop gets infected, the people who were at the shop get a message that serves a quarantine order and it is logged that they have entered quarantine. 

Simple Tracer consists of five key components:

1. **Flamingo**, the app for residents to check in to buildings. Built with Ionic.

2. **Eagle**, an API that manages checking in and out to allow for new solutions to be built. Built with Express and Node.js.

3. **Hummingbird**, a website that powers building registration and QR code generation. Built with HTML, CSS & JS.

4. **Hornbill**, a web app for contact tracers to identify contacts and issue quarantine orders.

5. **Parrot**, a python script for creating admin users for Hornbill.

Collectively, all of these can deployed with just a few clicks by following the guide below.

## Deployment Instructions

### ðŸš© Stage 1: Airtable

We use Airtable for a database. You can learn more about Airtable [here](https://airtable.com). The free plan for Airtable is sufficient to demo this app, however to deploy this solution in production you will almost certainly need the Airtable Enterprise plan. You can learn more about it [here](https://airtable.com/enterprise).

The reason for using Airtable is that it can be built on top of extremely quickly and every day counts in a pandemic. This will allow you to build custom solutions.

1. To begin, we need to create a workspace. Here is a [guide on how to do that](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004513573-Creating-a-new-workspace).

2. Next you need to make a copy of the base template we have created. You can find it [here](https://airtable.com/universe/expOoFmg86RVNcbcl/simple-tracer-base-template). Click `Copy Base` in the top right corner.

3. So that your deployments will be able to interact with your Airtable base we will need to get an API key and the Base key. To do this you must:

    1. Go to [this page](https://airtable.com/account). 
    
    2. Find the API section and click generate
    
    3. Copy the provided key this is your API key.
    
    4. To get the Base key go to [this page](https://airtable.com/api) and click the base we created earlier.
    
    5. Use control f or command f to find 'The ID of this base is' on the page.
    
    6. The ID following that will be your Base Key
    
    7. Make sure to note down both keys.
    

### ðŸš© Stage 2: Eagle

The next step is to deploy Eagle, the API. Here are the steps to do so these steps are for Heroku:

1. Click this [link](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/simple-tracer/eagle/).

2. Fill in your app name and a server location.

3. For the `AIRTABLE_BASE` enviromental variable, enter your Airtable Base Key.

4. For the `AIRTABLE_KEY` enviromental variable, enter your Airtable API Key.

5. For the `SECRET_KEY` enviromental variable, enter a random string of letters. You can use this [site](https://www.random.org/strings/). Don't forget this.

6. Click `Deploy App`.

7. Once the app is deployed, click `View App`. Copy the URL and take note of it.

### ðŸš© Stage 3: Twilio

This can get a bit complicated, we'll let the people over at Twilio explain with this [great guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/notify/quickstart/sms). It will run you through the process of creating a Notify service in Twilio. You only need to follow the guide up to the **Gather account information** section.

Once you are done you should have the following information:

| Config Value         | Description                                                                                                                                    
|-|-|
| Account SID          | Used to authenticate REST API requests - [find it in the Twilio console here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings).|
| Auth Token           | Used to authenticate REST API requests - [like the Account SID, find it in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings)|
| Service Instance SID | A  Notify Service instance where all the data for our application is stored and scoped. You created it in Twilio console in the above guide.|


### ðŸš© Stage 4: Hornbill

Now we want to deploy Hornbill, our admin tools system. This setup also uses Heroku and is similar to Eagle's.

1. Click this [link](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/simple-tracer/hornbill/).

2. Fill in your app name and a server location.

3. For the `AIRTABLE_BASE` enviromental variable, enter your Airtable Base Key.

4. For the `AIRTABLE_KEY` enviromental variable, enter your Airtable API Key.

5. For the `KEY` enviromental variable, we need to generate a key (unlike before we can't just use a random string of letters).

    1. To do this we will use Python, open your terminal and type python. Or use this [site](https://www.python.org/shell/) if you don't have Python installed.
    2. Next, type `import os` and click enter.
    3. Now, type `import base64` and click enter.
    4. To end, type `print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32)))`
    5. Copy the result, if your result has `b'` at the start delete that as well as the `'` at the end.

6. For the `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` enviromental variable, enter your Twilio Account SID you made earlier.

7. For the `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` enviromental variable, enter your Twilio Auth Token you made earlier.

8. For the `TWILIO_NOTIFY_SERVICE_SID` enviromental variable, enter your Twilio Service Instance SID you made earlier.

9. Click `Deploy App`.

10. Once the app is deployed, click `View App`. Welcome to Hornbill, but what is my password?

### ðŸš© Stage 5: Parrot

Parrot is a simple command line tool that allows you to add admin users so you can login to Hornbill.

1. Write the following in your terminal:

```
mkdir parrot

cd parrot

git clone https://github.com/simple-tracer/parrot.git

python3 parrot.py new
```

2. This will start the process of creating a new user. Fill in the requested details, make sure the `Secret key` is the same as made in Step 5 of the Hornbill stage.

3. Now you have created a new user, you can login in on Hornbill.

4. To update a user's password replace `new` with `update`. To delete a user replace `new` with `remove`.

### ðŸš© Stage 6: Flamingo

TBC.

**ðŸŽ‰ Amazing! We've succesfully set up Simple Tracer!**
